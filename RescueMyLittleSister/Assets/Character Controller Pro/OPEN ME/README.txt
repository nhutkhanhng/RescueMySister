Hi, first and foremost thank you very much for choosing this asset! I really hope it helps you in the development of your current and future projects!

--- Setting up the project ------------------------------------------------------- 
Please read the section "Setting up the project" from the online documentation. This is the first thing you need to do. It is mandatory to follow these instructions in order avoid errors.

The main issue will be the input setup, you can assign the input preset that comes with the asset and everything should work just fine (for more detail check the documentation).
